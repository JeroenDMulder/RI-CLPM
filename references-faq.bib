	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background:
              Cognitive ability and problem behaviour (externalising and internalising problems) are variable and inter-related in children. However, it is not known if they mutually influence one another, if difficulties in one cause difficulties in the other, or if they are related only because they share causes.
            
            
              Methods:
              Random-intercept cross-lagged models adjusted for confounding were fitted to explore this in 17,318 (51\% male) children of the UK’s Millennium Cohort Study at ages 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14 years. Externalising and internalising problems were assessed using the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Cognitive ability was measured using standardised scores of age-appropriate validated cognitive ability assessments. Where multiple cognitive assessments were available a single score was derived using principal components analysis.
            
            
              Results:
              There was much evidence for cross-domain longitudinal effects in childhood, especially for cognitive ability (on both internalising and externalising problems and in both males and females) and externalising problems (on internalising problems in both genders and cognitive ability in males). Bidirectional effects were childhood-limited, gender-specific and less consistent. The consistent bidirectional associations were, in males, between externalising problems and cognitive ability, and, in females, between externalising and internalising problems (although the effects of internalising problems were weak). In adolescence, only externalising problems had cross-domain effects such that, in both genders, they were associated with lower cognitive ability in subsequent measurements and increased levels of internalising problems.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              In either childhood or adolescence, reducing behavioural problems could have both emotional and cognitive benefits. In childhood, improving cognitive skills could reduce both emotional and behavioural problems.},

	abstract = {Researchers often combine longitudinal panel data analysis with tests of interactions (i.e., moderation). A popular example is the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). However, interaction tests in CLPMs and related models require caution because stable (i.e., between-level, B) and dynamic (i.e., within-level, W) sources of variation are present in longitudinal data, which can conflate estimates of interaction effects. We address this by integrating literature on CLPMs, multilevel moderation, and latent interactions. Distinguishing stable B and dynamic W parts, we describe three types of interactions that are of interest to researchers: 1) purely dynamic or WxW; 2) cross-level or BxW; and 3) purely stable or BxB. We demonstrate estimating latent interaction effects in a CLPM using a Bayesian SEM in Mplus to apply relationships among work-family conflict and job satisfaction, using gender as a stable B variable. We support our approach via simulations, demonstrating that our proposed CLPM approach is superior to a traditional CLPMs that conflate B and W sources of variation. We describe higher-order nonlinearities as a possible extension, and we discuss limitations and future research directions.},

In this essay, I focus on the assumptions needed to estimate mediation effects. I show that there is no “gold standard” method for the identification of causal mediation effects. In particular, mediation effects will always have the character of estimates from observational data since they are generally subject to a specific form of confounding. Additionally, I demonstrate how randomization of the mediator and instrumental variables methods lead to fundamentally different quantities than causal mediation analyses. I also review recent work that discusses how the assumptions of mediation analyses differ when there is treatment noncompliance or when there are multiple mediators. Throughout, I motivate concepts using path diagrams and an example of a classroom intervention designed to increase test scores.},
