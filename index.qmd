This website is a supplement to "Three Extensions of the Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model" by @mulder_three_2021. It contains Mplus syntax and lavaan (R-package) code for specifying the basic RI-CLPM and the following three extensions:

1. including a time-invariant predictor and outcome,
2. doing multiple group analysis, and
3. using multiple indictors for variables. 

Use the top menu to navigate to the [Mplus syntax](https://jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/mplus.html), [*lavaan* code](https://jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/lavaan.html), [News](https://jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/news.html), or [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/faq.html). The lavaan page additionally contains R code for performing the $\bar{\chi}^{2}$-test (chi-bar-square test), and R code for using the GORICA. The $\bar{\chi}^{2}$-test is used for comparing nested models where the more parsimonious model is based on constraining parameters on the bound of the parameter space (e.g., constraining a variance to 0). The GORICA is an information criterion that can be used for causal dominance hypothesis evaluation. The *News* tab documents important updates and additions to the Mplus syntax, *lavaan* model syntax, or the FAQ on this website.  

### Data
You can find simulated example data sets (1189 units, 5 repeated-measures) on [GitHub](https://github.com/jeroendmulder/RI-CLPM/tree/master/data) to get hands-on experience with this modeling approach. The example data are motivated by @narmandakh_bidirectional_2020, who obtained 5 waves of data from 1189 adolescents on their sleep problems and anxiety over 15 years.
