Click the question to see our response.\n\nCausality\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I interpreted cross-lagged effects causally?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe short answer is: It depends on whether the assumptions underlying RI-CLPMs hold. In practice, the cross-lagged effects that are obtained with the RI-CLPM (as well as with other cross-lagged models) are often interpreted as causal effects, sometimes quite explicitly, but oftentimes in a more implicit way through the use of specific language (e.g., when one variable is described to “react to”, “respond to”, “impact”, or “spill over into” another variable). Such an interpretation is valid if all assumptions underlying the analysis hold, which includes both parametric assumptions such as linearity and no interactions; and causal identification assumptions such as sequential exchangeability, consistency, and positivity. However, in applications of the RI-CLPM, these assumptions are rarely subject to explicit scrutiny, and therefore it is unclear if a causal interpretation of effects is valid (e.g., it is stated that under these assumptions the results can be interpreted causally, without a thorough discussion of the plausibility of these assumptions).\nFurthermore, there is more general criticism of the use of SEM models for causal inference by researchers from disciplines like epidemiology and biostatistics. They point out that SEM models depend heavily on parametric assumptions; since these are likely to be violated—at least to some degree—in practice, SEM is prone to bias when used for causal inference. The use of methods that have been developed in the potential outcomes framework is therefore recommended. Compared to SEM, these alternative methods rely less on parametric assumptions therefore should, in principle, lead to more robust causal inference. For a didactical introduction to this discussion, and more information on the role of cross-lagged panel research in causal inference, we refer the reader to Mulder, Luijken, Penning de Vries, and Hamaker (2024). We conclude that increased reliance on parametric assumptions (as in cross-lagged panel modeling) does not always translate to increased bias (even under mild model misspecification), researchers are still well-advised to acquaint themselves with causal methods from the potential outcomes framework.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluding covariates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I include time-varying covariates with the RI-CLPM?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inclusion of a single additional time-varying covariate (TVC) \\(Z\\) is commonly done similarly to how “regular” \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) outcomes are treated in the RI-CLPM; hence, rather than a bivariate RI-CLPM you would specify a tri- (or more-variate) RI-CLPM. As such, you decompose the TVC in within-components (e.g. \\(wz1\\), \\(wz2\\), etc.) and a between-component (a random intercept for \\(Z\\); e.g. \\(RI_{z}\\)) and model these components separately. However, if you want to control for many TVCs, this approach can quickly become unwieldly, leading to large statistical models that rely on many causal and statistical assumptions, and that can be hard to estimate. For researchers who want to adjust for a larger set of time-varying covariates, it might be worthwhile to consider alternative modeling approaches that have been proposed in the causal inference literature, such as those based on propensity scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to run an RI-CLPM with three (or more) outcomes?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, it is statistically possible to run a “trivariate” RI-CLPM and empirical researchers have done so, see for example Van Lissa et al. (2019), Flouri et al. (2019), and Hygen et al. (2022). We don’t provide model code here for this mode, but extension to a trivariate RI-CLPM should be relatively straight forwards. That is, all variables should be decomposed into between- (random intercepts) and within-components, and relevant lagged effects, as well as (residual) variances and covariances, should be included in the model.\n\n\n\n\n\nModeration and mediation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to specify a moderator within the RI-CLPM?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are various approaches for studying moderation within the RI-CLPM, depending on the measurement level of the moderator variable. Moderation by a time-invariant, categorical variable can be investigated using a multiple group RI-CLPM, as described in Extension 2 of Mulder and Hamaker (2021). Moderation by a time-varying, continuous variable can be investigating by creating latent interactions of the moderator \\(\\times\\) within-components, or the moderator \\(\\times\\) random intercept factor(s). See Ozkok et al. (2022) and Speyer et al. (2023) for detailed information on how to this.\nDue to the high computational burden that the inclusion of a continuous time-varying moderator places on the estimation, Ozkok et al. (2022) make use of a Bayesian estimator. Their supplemental materials, including the Mplus model syntax, can be found at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/10944281211043733. They note that currently only Mplus supports the use of latent interactions as used here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to test for mediation effects in the RI-CLPM?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it is statistically possible to include a third time-varying covariate into the RI-CLPM (which can be used to investigate mediation at the within-person level), there are multiple theoretical concerns that complicate the interpretation of estimates related to mediation. Researchers are strongly advised to give these concerns due consideration when interested in studying mediation using the RI-CLPM.\nFirst, there are multiple options for defining a direct effect, and it might not be straightforward which option is appropriate for a particular research question. That is, there are multiple paths not through the mediator variable \\(M\\) that represent an effect of \\(X\\) on a \\(Y\\) at a later occasion. For example, is the direct effect only the lag-2 effect \\(X_{1} \\rightarrow Y_{3}\\), or is the combination of the effects \\(X_{1} \\rightarrow Y_{2} \\rightarrow Y_{3}\\), \\(X_{1} \\rightarrow X_{2} \\rightarrow Y_{3}\\) and \\(X_{1} \\rightarrow Y_{3}\\)?\nSecond, mediation analysis is often causal in nature, as you want to know the mechanism by which a variable \\(X\\) influences another variable \\(Y\\). For a causal interpretation of the statistical estimates, you need to carefully evaluate the causal identification assumptions (i.e., exchangeability, consistency, and positivity), and rely on the statistical (parametric) assumptions that implied by the RI-CLPM (e.g., linearity, multivariate normality). Evaluation of these assumptions can be quite challenging, and you might find that your targeted causal mediation effect is not identified. Interested readers are referred to Keele (2015) for a short introduction to these assumptions in the context of mediation analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow should I interpret the standardized cross-lagged and autoregressive parameters?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the RI-CLPM, the standardized effects are reflective/representative of how much within-person variance in \\(y_{t}\\) is uniquely explained (i.e., not also explained by other predictors) by the predictor \\(x_{t-1}\\). Please note that this does not imply that one can make a one-on-one comparison with the percentage of explained variance. However, the standardized effects can be used to compare which effect is relatively stronger (Schuurman et al. 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do standardized cross-lagged and autoregressive parameters compare to explained variance?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standardized lagged parameters are not equal to the (squared) semipartial correlation. Only under special circumstances, a standardized regression coefficient is equal to the pairwise correlation between the outcome and predictor, and the square of the standardized regression coefficient would then be the explained variance (\\(R^{2}\\)). This only applies in the case of (a) a simple regression, where there is only one predictor in the model, or (b) a multiple regression where the predictors are independent of each other. In the RI-CLPM, however, the multiple predictors are not independent of each other, and therefore the standardized regression coefficients are not equal to the pairwise correlation, (semi)partial correlation, or the unique explained variance.\nHowever, the standardized coefficient is closely related to the semipartial correlation, as demonstrated in footnote 3 of Schuurman et al. (2016). The standardized coefficient is expressed in terms of pairwise correlations in the first equation there, and the semipartial correlation expressed in terms of pairwise correlations in the second equation. They are very similar, but there is a subtle difference in the denominator.\nSo, the semipartial correlation and standardized coefficient are not equal, but we can see that if the semipartical correlation for one predictor is larger than for another predictor, this will also be the case for the standardized coefficients of these predictors. The square of the semi-partial correlation is the unique explained variance, so we also know that the predictor with the largest standardized coefficient, will also have the largest unique explained variance.\nAnswer by dr. Noémi Schuurman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I constrain the standardized parameters to be invariant over time?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the lagged parameters can be constrained to be invariant over time, this does not imply that the standardized parameters will be invariant over time as well. The reason for this is that a standardized parameter is a function of the unstandardized parameter, and of the standard deviations of the predictor and the outcome variable, \\(\\beta_{standardized} = \\frac{SD(x)}{SD(y)}\\beta\\). Since the variances of the within-components themselves are not constrained to be invariant over time, the standard deviations of the predictor and the outcome variable for the lagged effects can vary over time. Therefore, the standardized lagged effects can vary even while the unstandardized lagged effects are constrained to be equal over time.\nTo make the standardized lagged parameters time invariant, the within-person components need to have a variance of 1 at every occasion. In that case, the lagged parameters are already the standardized lagged parameters, and it becomes possible to impose time-constraints on them. At the first wave, the variances of the within-components can be set directly as these variables are exogenous. However, for \\(t &gt; 1\\), the variances of the within-components are functions of the lagged parameters, and the covariance between the lagged predictors. Specifically, using the path tracing rules (Wright 1934) and assuming the variance of lagged within-component is in fact 1, the variance of \\(wx_{it}\\) can be expressed as \\[Var[wx_{it}] = \\alpha^{2}_{t} + \\gamma^{2}_{t} + 2 \\alpha_{t} \\gamma_{t} Cov[wx_{i,t-1}, wy_{i,t-1}] + Var[u_{it}]\\] where \\(\\alpha_{t}\\) is the autoregressive effect of \\(wx\\), \\(\\gamma{t}\\) is the cross-lagged effect from \\(wy_{i,t-1}\\) to \\(wx_{it}\\), and \\(u_{Xit}\\) is the residual of \\(wx\\). So, the variance of \\(wx_{it}\\) itself can be set to 1 by imposing a constrain on the residual variance \\(Var[u_{it}]\\), that is \\[Var[u_{it}] = 1 - (\\alpha^{2}_{t} + \\gamma^{2}_{t} + 2 \\alpha_{t} \\gamma_{t} Cov[wx_{i,t-1}, wy_{i,t-1}])\\].\nThe final quantity that we need to compute is the covariance (here also the correlation) between the two lagged within-components, \\(Cov[wx_{i,t-1}, wy_{i,t-1}]\\). At wave 1, this is simply a model parameter (i.e., the covariance between the within-components can be estimated directly). For \\(t &gt; 1\\), this covariance is a function of the lagged coefficients, the variances of the lagged within-components, and the covariance between the residuals at the preceding occasion. Again, using the path tracing rules and assuming the variances of lagged within-components are in fact 1, it can be expressed as \\[Cov[wx_{it}, wy_{it}] = \\alpha_{t} \\gamma_{t} + \\beta_{t} \\delta_{t} + \\alpha_{t} \\delta_{t} Cov[wx_{i,t-1}, wy_{i,t-1}] + \\beta_{t} \\gamma_{t} Cov[wx_{i,t-1}, wy_{i,t-1}] + Cov[u_{Xit}, u_{Yit}]\\] where \\(\\delta_{t}\\) is the autoregressive effect of \\(wy\\), \\(\\beta_{t}\\) is the cross-lagged effect from \\(wx_{i,t-1}\\) to \\(wy_{it}\\), and \\(u_{Yit}\\) is the residual of \\(wy\\).\nTo impose such constraints in Mplus or lavaan, we thus first need to compute the covariance (i.e., correlation) between the within-components at each occasion. Then, these can be used to constrain the residual variances of the within-components in such a way that the variances of the within-person components equal 1. Syntax has been added to this website to specify this model in Mplus and lavaan. Note that in this model, the factor loadings that link the observed variables to the within-components are not fixed to 1 as is usually done, but they are estimated freely.\nAnswer by prof. dr. Ellen L. Hamaker.\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-continuous outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I run the RI-CLPM with binary/categorical/count outcomes?\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Mplus version 8.7 and later, it is possible to estimate the RI-CLPM for binary and ordinal variables as well (Asparouhov and Muthén 2021). Compared to the RI-CLPM for continuous variables, there are two important differences:\n\nA Bayesian estimator or WLSMV estimator (with theta parametrization) is needed. This can be specified by specifying either ESTIMATOR = BAYES; or ESTIMATOR = WLSMV; in the ANALYSIS command, as well as PARAM = THETA; for the WLSMV estimator.\nThe variances and residual variances of the within-components are fixed to 1, as is standard when using the probit-model in Mplus for categorical data analysis. These can be freely estimated in principle, but generally require larger sample sizes, and are prone to empirical non-identification. Several strategies for (partly) freeing up these variances are discussed in Asparouhov and Muthén (2021).\n\nThe interested reader is referred to Asparouhov and Muthén (2021) for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\nPower\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I perform a power analysis for the RI-CLPM?\n\n\n\n\n\npowRICLPM is an R-package that performs a power analysis for the RI-CLPM in a simple and user-friendly way. It implements the strategy as proposed by Mulder (2023), and includes various extensions such as the inclusion of measurement error (leading to the stable trait autoregressive trait state model by Kenny and Zautra (2001), and multiple constraints over time. powRICLPM is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). More information can be found at https://jeroendmulder.github.io/powRICLPM/.\n\n\n\n\n\nCLPM v. RICLPM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are the autoregressive effects in the RI-CLPM typically smaller than in the CLPM?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe autoregressive effects in the CLPM and the RI-CLPM capture two distinct phenomena. In the traditional CLPM, the autoregressive effects capture both within- and between-unit effects, and it can be interpreted as rank-order stability. In the RI-CLPM, the stable, between-person variance is separated from the within-person variance such that the autoregressive effects only capture within-person carry-over. In other words, in the RI-CLPM the autoregressive effects are typically smaller because the stable, trait-like stability is not captured anymore by the autoregressive effects (as in the CLPM), but by the random intercepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it a bad sign that the standard errors are typically larger in the RI-CLPM than in the CLPM?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, this is to be expected because the RI-CLPM is a more complex model than the CLPM. Therefore, the point estimates are less certain, but this does not imply that the estimates are biased and the model does not give us any insight in the underlying mechanism under study. In contrast, the RI-CLPM is likely less biased than results from the CLPM because the RI-CLM accounts for stable, unobserved factors that create lasting between-person differences, which can create spurious empirical relationships between the constructs under investigation when not properly accounted for.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth and development\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can the RI-CLPM incorporate growth over time?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RI-CLPM estimates grand means at each time point. If these are constrained to be time-invariant, this would imply that on average there is no change. However, if these constraints cannot be imposed on the model, this means that on average there is some kind of change (e.g., growth, decline, U-shape, sudden jump between two waves, etc.). In this case, the model implies that every person is modeled to have the exact same underlying trend over time, but at a constant deviation from the average trend (as captured by the random intercept factor). Hence, instead of talking about constant means over time, one would have to talk about constant deviations from an average trend.\nIn the latent growth curve model (LGCM) and its extension, the latent curve model with structured residuals (LCM-SR), it is assumed that individual have the same kind of trend (e.g., a linear or quadratic trend), but there can be individual differences in the parameters of this trend; as a result, the differences between individuals change over time (i.e., they may increase or decrease). When the variance of the slope components (i.e., the slope factor of both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in the bivariate case) is fixed to zero, the LGCM and LCS-SR become special cases of the RI-CLPM; if the grand means in the RI-CLPM are fixed to be invariant over time, then this is a special case of the LCM-SR (Usami, Murayama, and Hamaker 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse to Orth et al. (2021)\nLately, we have received numerous questions about statements regarding the use and appropriateness of the CLPM and RI-CLPM in “Testing Prospective Effects in Longitudinal Research: Comparing Seven Competing Cross-Lagged Models” by Orth et al. (2021). In our opinion, numerous conclusions herein are incorrect. Below we elaborate on some of their most prominent conclusions. For another reaction to this article, see https://replicationindex.com/2020/08/22/cross-lagged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RI-CLPM is not suited for studying prospective between-person effects, whereas the CLPM is.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn page 1026, Orth et al. (2021) state that the RI-CLPM does not allow for the testing of prospective between-person effects because “(…) the random intercept factors provide information only about correlational associations between the constructs (…), but not about time-lagged (i.e, longitudinal) and directional between-person effects.” It is true that the RI-CLPM separates stable, between-person differences from temporal, within-person fluctuations. Only the latter allow one to look at prospective effects over time, while the stable between-person differences have no particular time-order.\nThe reasoning that Orth et al. (2021) seem to follow is this: If one is interested in trait-changes, we should not separate the stable trait components from the temporary fluctuations, as the first does not allow for the study of prospective effects and are not of interest because they are entirely stable, while the latter only contain state-like fluctuations that are less interesting to researchers who want to study in trait-changes. Orth et al. (2021) seem to consider both components separately not to be of interest, but nevertheless argue that a blend of both components is of key interest. We disagree with this reasoning.\nResearchers who want to use prospective effects to study certain psychological processes, should make sure that their measurements are obtained at the time scale at which they believe the process of interest operates. If the trait-changes of interest are assumed to take place from one year to the next, then measuring yearly over several years should capture the fluctuations of interest within persons over the time span covered by the study. If trait-changes are assumed to take place at a less fine time scale, such as from decade to decade, this implies researchers should obtain data measured once per decade, for several decades.\nEven if the stable, between-person differences are not of interest, these nevertheless need to be separated from the within-person fluctuations. The stable mean differences between persons are often referred to as trait differences, but may also be conceptualized as resulting from stable confounders, such as stable genetic and environmental factors that affect our measurements.\nIn sum, the focus should be on how the constructs are measured, specifically at what time scale they are measured. By definition, the random intercepts in the RI-CLPM capture variance that is stable over the duration of the study, which is why—from a data analytical perspective—these are referred to as traits. What remains is variance within persons over time, which is why—again from a data analytical perspective—this is referred to as state-like. These trait-like between-person differences and state-like, within-person fluctuations need not coincide perfectly with the trait-state distinction made by substantive researchers. Nevertheless, it is essential to separate these two sources, regardless of what they are called.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RI-CLPM is better suited for short-term studies because it cannot detect sustained prospective effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe characterization of the lagged effects as short- or long-term depends on the time scale at which the measurements are made. When using annual data, lagged effects capture the fluctuation from year to year; when dealing with data that were obtained every decade, the within-person fluctuations will concern the changes from decade to decade. It is all relative to how the data were measured, and even when we are focusing on trait changes by measuring people once every 10 years, for say 40 years, there will still be stable between-person differences between individuals that need to be controlled for.\nHence, the need to decompose the observations into a stable between-person component and temporal within-person components is independent of the time scale at which measurements were obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere should be a match between the type of research question asked and the model used: The CLPM is for the analysis of between-person prospective effects whereas the RI-CLPM should be used for within-person prospective effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe agree with the authors in so far that there should be a match between the research question and the statistical model used. However, the critical distinction here is not whether one is interested in within-person or between-person prospective effects (as argued above, the RI-CLPM can capture trait-changes depending on the time scale at which measurements are gathered). Rather, we should distinguish between descriptive, predictive, and causal research questions (Hamaker, Mulder, and Van IJzendoorn 2020). The CLPM is suitable for predictive research questions: e.g., “Who is at risk for heightened \\(X\\)?” and “Who should get an intervention to reduce \\(Y\\)?”. However, for answering causal research questions, other models should be used, because the CLPM does not control for stable, between-person difference. This is problematic as failing to properly account for such confounding effects can lead to finding spurious lagged effects, a failure to find true relationships, or more generally, biased estimates (Hamaker, Kuiper, and Grasman 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parameters from the CLPM tend to have smaller standard errors than the parameters from the RI-CLPM; hence, the results from the CLPM are easier to replicate, which may be a reason to prefer this model.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn page 1028, Orth et al. (2021) state that “For the CLPM, the structural coefficients were much more consistent compared to the RI-CLPM, both across and within samples, which is important with regard to replicability of research findings (Asendorf et al., 2013). Even if theoretical consideration have priority over replicability in model selection, replicability of estimates is—other things being equal—an important criterion of the quality of statistical models.”\nWhen the goal is prediction, this may indeed be an important consideration. However, when the goal is to gain insight in the underlying mechanism, we should not prefer a model simply based on its ability to replicate results: Replicating biased results is only giving us false confidence in erroneous conclusions.\nInstead, we should consider which model seems more reasonable (e.g., do we believe there may be unobserved, stable confounding that plays a role in our measurements?), and which model provides a better description of the data (e.g., comparing competing models through the use of the chi-square difference test, or information criteria).\nThe larger standard errors associated with the RI-CLPM imply that if we want to have the higher precision and/or increase replicability, we need to obtain data from larger samples and/or at more waves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAsparouhov, Tihomir, and Bengt Muthén. 2021. “Residual Structural Equation Models.” http://statmodel.com/download/Asparouhov_Muthen_2021a.pdf.\n\n\nFlouri, Eirini, Efstathios Papachristou, Emily Midouhas, George B.

The \\(\\bar{\\chi}^{2}\\)-test is used for comparing nested models where the more parsimonious model is based on constraining parameters on the bound of the parameter space (e.g., constraining a variance to 0). The GORICA is an information criterion that can be used for causal dominance hypothesis evaluation. The News tab documents important updates and additions to the Mplus syntax, lavaan model syntax, or the FAQ on this website.\n\nData\nYou can find simulated example data sets (1189 units, 5 repeated-measures) on GitHub to get hands-on experience with this modeling approach. The example data are motivated by Narmandakh et al. (2020), who obtained 5 waves of data from 1189 adolescents on their sleep problems and anxiety over 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMulder, Jeroen D., and Ellen L.

It is specified using the =~ command, RIx =~ 1*x1 + 1*x2 ..., where 1* fixes the factor loading to one.\nA within part, consisting of within-unit fluctuations. It is also specified using the =~ command, wx1 =~ 1*x1; wx2 =~ 1*x2; ....\nThe lagged regressions between the within-unit components, using wx2 + wy2 ~ wx1 + wy1; wx3 + wy3 ~ wx2 + wy2; ....\nRelevant covariances in both the between and within part. In the within part the components at wave 1, and their residuals at waves 2 and further are correlated within each wave, using wx1 ~~ wy1; wx2 ~~ wy2;.... We also need to specify their (residual) variances here using wx1 ~~ wx1; wx2 ~~ wx2; .... For the between part we have to specify the variances and covariance of the random intercepts using RIx ~~ RIy;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe models below are fitted using the lavaan() function. Other functions for fitting SEM models using lavaan include sem() and cfa(). These functions rely on different defaults than lavaan() and fitting the below models with these functions can result in model misspecification and subsequently convergence issues.\n\n\n\n\nThe basic modelConstraints over timeConstrain standardized lagged effects\n\n\nThe code for specifying the basic RI-CLPM is given below.\n\nRICLPM &lt;- '\n  # Create between components (random intercepts)\n  RIx =~ 1*x1 + 1*x2 + 1*x3 + 1*x4 + 1*x5\n  RIy =~ 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3 + 1*y4 + 1*y5\n  \n  # Create within-person centered variables\n  wx1 =~ 1*x1\n  wx2 =~ 1*x2\n  wx3 =~ 1*x3 \n  wx4 =~ 1*x4\n  wx5 =~ 1*x5\n  wy1 =~ 1*y1\n  wy2 =~ 1*y2\n  wy3 =~ 1*y3\n  wy4 =~ 1*y4\n  wy5 =~ 1*y5\n\n  # Estimate lagged effects between within-person centered variables\n  wx2 + wy2 ~ wx1 + wy1\n  wx3 + wy3 ~ wx2 + wy2\n  wx4 + wy4 ~ wx3 + wy3\n  wx5 + wy5 ~ wx4 + wy4\n\n  # Estimate covariance between within-person centered variables at first wave\n  wx1 ~~ wy1 # Covariance\n  \n  # Estimate covariances between residuals of within-person centered variables \n  # (i.e., innovations)\n  wx2 ~~ wy2\n  wx3 ~~ wy3\n  wx4 ~~ wy4\n  wx5 ~~ wy5\n  \n  # Estimate variance and covariance of random intercepts\n  RIx ~~ RIx\n  RIy ~~ RIy\n  RIx ~~ RIy\n\n  # Estimate (residual) variance of within-person centered variables\n  wx1 ~~ wx1 # Variances\n  wy1 ~~ wy1 \n  wx2 ~~ wx2 # Residual variances\n  wy2 ~~ wy2 \n  wx3 ~~ wx3 \n  wy3 ~~ wy3 \n  wx4 ~~ wx4 \n  wy4 ~~ wy4 \n  wx5 ~~ wx5\n  wy5 ~~ wy5\n'\n\n\n\nImposing constraints to the model can be achieved through pre-multiplication. It means that we have to prepend the number that we want to fix the parameter to, and an asterisk, to the parameter in the model specification. For example, F =~ 0*x1 fixes the factor loading of item x1 to factor F to 0. Using pre-multiplication we can also constrain parameters to be the same by giving them the same label. Below we specify an RI-CLPM with the following constraints:\n\nfixed auto-regressive and cross-lagged relations over time, wx2 ~ a*wx1 + b*wy1; ...,\ntime-invariant (residual) (co-)variances in the within-person part wx2 ~~ cov*wy2; ..., wx2 ~~ vx*wx2; ..., and wy2 ~~ vy*wy2; ..., and\nconstrained grand means over time, x1 + ... ~ mx*1 and y1 + ... ~ my*1.\n\n\nRICLPM5 &lt;- '\n  # Create between components (random intercepts)\n  RIx =~ 1*x1 + 1*x2 + 1*x3 + 1*x4 + 1*x5\n  RIy =~ 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3 + 1*y4 + 1*y5\n  \n  # Create within-person centered variables\n  wx1 =~ 1*x1\n  wx2 =~ 1*x2\n  wx3 =~ 1*x3 \n  wx4 =~ 1*x4\n  wx5 =~ 1*x5\n  wy1 =~ 1*y1\n  wy2 =~ 1*y2\n  wy3 =~ 1*y3\n  wy4 =~ 1*y4\n  wy5 =~ 1*y5\n  \n  # Estimate lagged effects between within-person centered variables \n  # (constrained)\n  wx2 ~ a*wx1 + b*wy1 \n  wy2 ~ c*wx1 + d*wy1\n  wx3 ~ a*wx2 + b*wy2\n  wy3 ~ c*wx2 + d*wy2\n  wx4 ~ a*wx3 + b*wy3\n  wy4 ~ c*wx3 + d*wy3\n  wx5 ~ a*wx4 + b*wy4\n  wy5 ~ c*wx4 + d*wy4\n  \n  # Estimate covariances between residuals of within-person centered variables \n  # (i.e., innovations, constrained)\n  wx2 ~~ cov*wy2\n  wx3 ~~ cov*wy3\n  wx4 ~~ cov*wy4 \n  wx5 ~~ cov*wy5\n  \n  # Estimate covariance between within-person centered variables at first wave\n  wx1 ~~ wy1 # Covariance\n  \n  # Estimate variance and covariance of random intercepts\n  RIx ~~ RIx\n  RIy ~~ RIy\n  RIx ~~ RIy\n  \n  # Estimate (residual) variance of within-person centered variables \n  # (constrained)\n  wx1 ~~ wx1 # Variance\n  wy1 ~~ wy1 \n  wx2 ~~ vx*wx2 # Residual variance\n  wy2 ~~ vy*wy2 \n  wx3 ~~ vx*wx3 \n  wy3 ~~ vy*wy3 \n  wx4 ~~ vx*wx4 \n  wy4 ~~ vy*wy4 \n  wx5 ~~ vx*wx5\n  wy5 ~~ vy*wy5\n  \n  # Constrain grand means over time\n  x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 ~ mx*1\n  y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 ~ my*1\n'\nRICLPM5.fit &lt;- lavaan(RICLPM5, \n  data = dat, \n  missing = 'ML', \n  meanstructure = T, \n  int.ov.free = T\n) \nsummary(RICLPM5.fit, standardized = T)\n\n\n\nRather than imposing constraints on the unstandardized auto-regressive and cross-lagged relations over time, we can impose constraints on the standardized lagged effects, as explained in the FAQ. Compared to the previous model (with constraints over time on the unstandardized lagged effects), there are multiple changes to the syntax. First, we freely estimate the factor loadings that link the observed variables to the within-components (by premultiplying with NA), rather than fixing them to 1:\n\n'\n  # Create within-components with freely estimated factor loadings\n  wx1 =~ NA*x1\n  wx2 =~ NA*x2\n  wx3 =~ NA*x3 \n  wx4 =~ NA*x4\n  wx5 =~ NA*x5\n  wy1 =~ NA*y1\n  wy2 =~ NA*y2\n  wy3 =~ NA*y3\n  wy4 =~ NA*y4\n  wy5 =~ NA*y5\n'\n\nSecond, we set the variances of within-components at first wave to 1, and label the covariance (now also the correlation) between them:\n\n'\n  # Set variances of within-components at first wave to 1\n  wx1 ~~ 1*wx1\n  wy1 ~~ 1*wy1\n  \n  # Estimate correlation between within-components at first wave\n  wx1 ~~ cor1*wy1 \n'\n\nThird, we give the residual variance and covariances between the within-component each a unique label:\n\n'\n  # Label residual covariances\n  wx2 ~~ rcov2*wy2\n  wx3 ~~ rcov3*wy3\n  wx4 ~~ rcov4*wy4 \n  wx5 ~~ rcov5*wy5\n  \n  # Label residual variances\n  wx2 ~~ rvx2*wx2 \n  wy2 ~~ rvy2*wy2 \n  wx3 ~~ rvx3*wx3 \n  wy3 ~~ rvy3*wy3 \n  wx4 ~~ rvx4*wx4 \n  wy4 ~~ rvy4*wy4 \n  wx5 ~~ rvx5*wx5\n  wy5 ~~ rvy5*wy5\n\n'\n\nFinally, we compute the correlations between the within-components themselves at each wave, and then constrain the residual variances to ensure that the total variance of each within-component equals 1. This is done with the := command:\n\n'\n  # Compute correlations of within-components at each wave\n  cor2 := a*c + b*d + a*d*cor1 + b*c*cor1 + rcov2\n  cor3 := a*c + b*d + a*d*cor2 + b*c*cor2 + rcov3\n  cor4 := a*c + b*d + a*d*cor3 + b*c*cor3 + rcov4\n \n  # Contrain residual variances of within-components such that variance of each \n  # within-component equals 1\n  rvx2 == 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor1)\n  rvy2 == 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor1)\n  rvx3 == 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor2)\n  rvy3 == 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor2)\n  rvx4 == 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor3)\n  rvy4 == 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor3)\n  rvx5 == 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor4)\n  rvy5 == 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor4)\n'\n\nThese steps ultimately result in the below syntax. Comparing the constrainted unstandardized and constrained standardized results shows that these are now equivalent.\n\nRICLPM6 &lt;- '\n  # Create between components (random intercepts)\n  RIx =~ 1*x1 + 1*x2 + 1*x3 + 1*x4 + 1*x5\n  RIy =~ 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3 + 1*y4 + 1*y5\n  \n  # Create within-components with freely estimated factor loadings\n  wx1 =~ NA*x1\n  wx2 =~ NA*x2\n  wx3 =~ NA*x3 \n  wx4 =~ NA*x4\n  wx5 =~ NA*x5\n  wy1 =~ NA*y1\n  wy2 =~ NA*y2\n  wy3 =~ NA*y3\n  wy4 =~ NA*y4\n  wy5 =~ NA*y5\n  \n  # Estimate lagged effects between within-person centered variables \n  # (constrained)\n  wx2 ~ a*wx1 + b*wy1 \n  wy2 ~ c*wx1 + d*wy1\n  wx3 ~ a*wx2 + b*wy2\n  wy3 ~ c*wx2 + d*wy2\n  wx4 ~ a*wx3 + b*wy3\n  wy4 ~ c*wx3 + d*wy3\n  wx5 ~ a*wx4 + b*wy4\n  wy5 ~ c*wx4 + d*wy4\n  \n  # Label residual covariances\n  wx2 ~~ rcov2*wy2\n  wx3 ~~ rcov3*wy3\n  wx4 ~~ rcov4*wy4 \n  wx5 ~~ rcov5*wy5\n  \n  # Estimate correlation between within-components at first wave\n  wx1 ~~ cor1*wy1 \n  \n  # Estimate variance and covariance of random intercepts\n  RIx ~~ RIx\n  RIy ~~ RIy\n  RIx ~~ RIy\n  \n  # Set variances of within-components at first wave to 1\n  wx1 ~~ 1*wx1\n  wy1 ~~ 1*wy1\n  \n  # Label residual variances\n  wx2 ~~ rvx2*wx2 \n  wy2 ~~ rvy2*wy2 \n  wx3 ~~ rvx3*wx3 \n  wy3 ~~ rvy3*wy3 \n  wx4 ~~ rvx4*wx4 \n  wy4 ~~ rvy4*wy4 \n  wx5 ~~ rvx5*wx5\n  wy5 ~~ rvy5*wy5\n  \n  # Constrain grand means over time\n  x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 ~ mx*1\n  y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 ~ my*1\n  \n  # Compute correlations of within-components at each wave\n  cor2 := a*c + b*d + a*d*cor1 + b*c*cor1 + rcov2\n  cor3 := a*c + b*d + a*d*cor2 + b*c*cor2 + rcov3\n  cor4 := a*c + b*d + a*d*cor3 + b*c*cor3 + rcov4\n \n  # Contrain residual variances of within-components such that variance of each \n  # within-component equals 1\n  rvx2 == 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor1)\n  rvy2 == 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor1)\n  rvx3 == 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor2)\n  rvy3 == 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor2)\n  rvx4 == 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor3)\n  rvy4 == 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor3)\n  rvx5 == 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor4)\n  rvy5 == 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor4)\n'\nRICLPM6.fit &lt;- lavaan(RICLPM6, \n  data = dat, \n  missing = 'ML', \n  meanstructure = T, \n  int.ov.free = T\n) \nsummary(RICLPM6.fit, standardized = F)\nsummary(RICLPM6.fit, standardized = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension 1: Including time-invariant predictors and outcomes\nUse the tabs below to navigate to the model specification of the RI-CLPM with\n\na time-invariant predictor \\(z_{1}\\) of the observed variables (\\(z_{1}\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) observed),\na time-invariant predictor \\(z_{1}\\) of the random intercepts (\\(z_{1}\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) RIs),\nrandom intercepts predicting a time-invariant outcome \\(z_{2}\\) (RIs \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(z_{2}\\)), or\nwithin components predicting a time-invariant outcome \\(z_{2}\\) (within \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(z_{2}\\)).\n\n\n\\(z_{1}\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) observed\\(z_{1}\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) RIsRIs \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(z_{2}\\)within \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(z_{2}\\)\n\n\nBelow you can find the code for an RI-CLPM with 5 waves and a time-invariant predictor \\(z_{1}\\) for the observed variables.

However, when constraints are placed on the bound of the parameter space, we should use the chi-bar-square test (\\(\\bar{\\chi}^{2}\\)-test) (Stoel et al. 2006). For example, if we constrain the variances of all random intercepts (and their covariance) in the RI-CLPM to zero, we obtain a model that is nested under the RI-CLPM, and that is statistically equivalent to the traditional cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). Below you can find R code for performing the chi-bar-square test (code by Rebecca M. Kuiper) for comparing these two models. It involves\n\nfitting both the RI-CLPM (RICLPM.fit) and CLPM (CLPM.fit);\nextracting the covariance matrix of the random intercepts;\nextracting the \\(\\chi^{2}\\) and degrees of freedom of both models; and\nperforming the \\(\\bar{\\chi}^{2}\\)-test using the ChiBarSq.DiffTest package (Kuiper 2020).\n\n\n# Install and load required packages\n## library(devtools)\n## install_github(\"rebeccakuiper/ChiBarSq.DiffTest\")\nlibrary(ChiBarSq.DiffTest)\n\n# Step 1: Fit RI-CLPM (RICLPM.fit) and CLPM (CLPM.fit)\n\n# Step 2: Find indices needed for covariance matrix of random intercepts\nvcov(RICLPM.fit) # Full covariance matrix\nindices &lt;- c(22, 23) # The 22nd and 23rd indices regard random intercepts\nq &lt;- length(indices) # Number of random intercepts\nS &lt;- vcov(RICLPM.fit)[indices, indices] # Extract covariance matrix of random intercepts\n\n# Step 3: Extract Chi-square and degrees of freedom\nChi2_clpm &lt;- summary(CLPM.fit, fit.measures = TRUE)[1]$FIT[c(\"chisq\")] \nChi2_riclpm &lt;- summary(RICLPM.fit, fit.measures = TRUE)[1]$FIT[c(\"chisq\")]\n\ndf_clpm &lt;- summary(CLPM.fit, fit.measures = TRUE)[1]$FIT[c(\"df\")]\ndf_riclpm &lt;- summary(RICLPM.fit, fit.measures = TRUE)[1]$FIT[c(\"df\")]\n\n# Step 4: Perform Chi-bar-square test (and obtain Chi-bar-square weights)\nChiBar2DiffTest &lt;- ChiBarSq.DiffTest(q, S, Chi2_clpm, Chi2_riclpm, df_clpm, df_riclpm)\nChiBar2DiffTest\nChiBar2DiffTest$p_value\n\n\n\n\nGORICA\nRather than evaluating a null-hypothesis of no effect, researchers may be interested in evaluating a theory-based, informative hypothesis (Altinisik et al. 2021). Informative hypotheses can reflect a priori theories, and often contain orderings of (standardized) parameters. For example, one may hypothesize that one cross-lagged relationship is higher than another one; often referred to as “causal dominance”. Such a causal dominance hypothesis can be evaluated with an AIC-type criterion called the GORICA (Altinisik et al. 2021; Sukpan and Kuiper 2023). Below you find code for evaluating a causal dominance hypothesis using the GORICA, for both the RI-CLPM with time-independent and time-specific parameters. We make use of the example data provided with these online supplementary materials. For more information, we refer to https://github.com/rebeccakuiper/Tutorials.\n\nThe basic modelConstraints over time\n\n\nIn the below R code we use the GORICA to test the informative hypothesis that the cross-lagged effects from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\) are stronger than those from \\(Y\\) to \\(X\\) (i.e., \\(X\\) is causally dominant). To specify the informative hypothesis, we use the labels of parameters as used in the model syntax: b2, c2, b3, c3, etc. Analysis shows that the informative hypothesis has 13.137 times more support than its complement (i.e., that there is no causal dominance, or that \\(Y\\) is causally dominant).\n\n# R package for testing of linear (in)equality restrictions on parameters in linear models\nlibrary(restriktor)\n\n# Informative hypothesis about cross-lagged effects (using parameter labels in model)\nH1 &lt;- \"abs(b2) &lt; abs(c2); abs(b3) &lt; abs(c3); \n       abs(b4) &lt; abs(c4); abs(b5) &lt; abs(c5)\" \n\n# Fit RI-CLPM\nRICLPM_H1 &lt;- '\n  # Create between components (random intercepts)\n  RIx =~ 1*x1 + 1*x2 + 1*x3 + 1*x4 + 1*x5\n  RIy =~ 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3 + 1*y4 + 1*y5\n  \n  # Create within-person centered variables\n  wx1 =~ 1*x1\n  wx2 =~ 1*x2\n  wx3 =~ 1*x3 \n  wx4 =~ 1*x4\n  wx5 =~ 1*x5\n  \n  wy1 =~ 1*y1\n  wy2 =~ 1*y2\n  wy3 =~ 1*y3\n  wy4 =~ 1*y4\n  wy5 =~ 1*y5\n\n  # Estimate lagged effects between within-person centered variables\n  wx2 ~ a2*wx1 + b2*wy1 \n  wy2 ~ c2*wx1 + d2*wy1\n  \n  wx3 ~ a3*wx2 + b3*wy2\n  wy3 ~ c3*wx2 + d3*wy2\n  \n  wx4 ~ a4*wx3 + b4*wy3\n  wy4 ~ c4*wx3 + d4*wy3\n  \n  wx5 ~ a5*wx4 + b5*wy4\n  wy5 ~ c5*wx4 + d5*wy4\n\n  # Estimate covariance between within-person centered variables at first wave\n  wx1 ~~ wy1 # Covariance\n  \n  # Estimate covariances between residuals of within-person centered variables \n  # (i.e., innovations)\n  wx2 ~~ wy2\n  wx3 ~~ wy3\n  wx4 ~~ wy4\n  wx5 ~~ wy5\n  \n  # Estimate variance and covariance of random intercepts\n  RIx ~~ RIx\n  RIy ~~ RIy\n  RIx ~~ RIy\n\n  # Estimate (residual) variance of within-person centered variables\n  wx1 ~~ wx1 # Variances\n  wy1 ~~ wy1 \n  wx2 ~~ wx2 # Residual variances\n  wy2 ~~ wy2 \n  wx3 ~~ wx3 \n  wy3 ~~ wy3 \n  wx4 ~~ wx4 \n  wy4 ~~ wy4 \n  wx5 ~~ wx5\n  wy5 ~~ wy5\n'\n\nfit_H1 &lt;- lavaan(\n  model = RICLPM_H1,\n  data = dat, \n  missing = \"ML\", \n  meanstructure = TRUE, \n  int.ov.free = TRUE\n)\n\nsummary(fit_H1, standardized = TRUE)\n\n# Compute GORICA values and weights (use `standardized = TRUE`)\nGORICA_H1 &lt;- goric(\n  fit_H1, \n  standardized = TRUE,\n  hypotheses = list(H1ws.l = H1), \n  comparison = \"complement\", # Test informative hypothesis versus its complement\n  type = \"gorica\"\n)\n\nGORICA_H1\n\n\n\nThe GORICA can also be used to test informative hypotheses when parameters are constrained over time. In the below R code, the lagged effects, residuals variances, and intercepts are restricted to be time-invariant. We again use the GORICA to test the informative hypothesis that the cross-lagged effects from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\) are stronger than those from \\(Y\\) to \\(X\\) (i.e., \\(X\\) is causally dominant). Analysis shows that the informative hypothesis has 785.564 times more support than its complement (i.e., that there is no causal dominance, or that \\(Y\\) is causally dominant).\n\n# Informative hypothesis about time-invariant cross-lagged effects \nH2 &lt;- \"abs(b) &lt; abs(c)\" \n\n# Fit RI-CLPM\nRICLPM_H2 &lt;- '\n  # Create between components (random intercepts)\n  RIx =~ 1*x1 + 1*x2 + 1*x3 + 1*x4 + 1*x5\n  RIy =~ 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3 + 1*y4 + 1*y5\n  \n  # Create within-person centered variables\n  wx1 =~ 1*x1\n  wx2 =~ 1*x2\n  wx3 =~ 1*x3 \n  wx4 =~ 1*x4\n  wx5 =~ 1*x5\n  wy1 =~ 1*y1\n  wy2 =~ 1*y2\n  wy3 =~ 1*y3\n  wy4 =~ 1*y4\n  wy5 =~ 1*y5\n  \n  # Estimate lagged effects between within-person centered variables \n  # (constrained)\n  wx2 ~ a*wx1 + b*wy1 \n  wy2 ~ c*wx1 + d*wy1\n  wx3 ~ a*wx2 + b*wy2\n  wy3 ~ c*wx2 + d*wy2\n  wx4 ~ a*wx3 + b*wy3\n  wy4 ~ c*wx3 + d*wy3\n  wx5 ~ a*wx4 + b*wy4\n  wy5 ~ c*wx4 + d*wy4\n  \n  # Estimate covariances between residuals of within-person centered variables \n  # (i.e., innovations, constrained)\n  wx2 ~~ cov*wy2\n  wx3 ~~ cov*wy3\n  wx4 ~~ cov*wy4 \n  wx5 ~~ cov*wy5\n  \n  # Estimate covariance between within-person centered variables at first wave\n  wx1 ~~ wy1 # Covariance\n  \n  # Estimate variance and covariance of random intercepts\n  RIx ~~ RIx\n  RIy ~~ RIy\n  RIx ~~ RIy\n  \n  # Estimate (residual) variance of within-person centered variables \n  # (constrained)\n  wx1 ~~ wx1 # Variance\n  wy1 ~~ wy1 \n  wx2 ~~ vx*wx2 # Residual variance\n  wy2 ~~ vy*wy2 \n  wx3 ~~ vx*wx3 \n  wy3 ~~ vy*wy3 \n  wx4 ~~ vx*wx4 \n  wy4 ~~ vy*wy4 \n  wx5 ~~ vx*wx5\n  wy5 ~~ vy*wy5\n  \n  # Constrain grand means over time\n  x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 ~ mx*1\n  y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 ~ my*1\n'\n\nfit_H2 &lt;- lavaan(\n  model = RICLPM_H2,\n  data = dat, \n  missing = \"ML\", \n  meanstructure = TRUE, \n  int.ov.free = TRUE\n)\n\nsummary(fit_H2, standardized = TRUE)\n\n# Compute GORICA values and weights\nGORICA_H2 &lt;- goric(\n  fit_H2, \n  hypotheses = list(H2), \n  comparison = \"complement\", # Test informative hypothesis versus its complement\n  type = \"gorica\"\n)\n\nGORICA_H2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAltinisik, Yasin, Caspar J.

    "text": "For Mplus (Muthén and Muthén 2017) to work properly, make sure that you save the input file with the model specification (example.inp) in the same folder as the data (example.dat). You can download the simulated example datasets here. Mplus includes defaults, like that:\n\nobserved and latent exogenous variables are correlated, and\nresiduals of observed and latent outcome variables (which do not predict anything) in a path model are correlated.\n\nThese defaults are included to make the specification of many standard SEM models easier, but they are not always useful in the current modeling context. Therefore, we use the command ANALYSIS: MODEL = NOCOV; to overrule these defaults for the covariances and set all of them to zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMplus residual language\n\n\n\nFrom Mplus version 8.7 onward, the Residual Structural Equation Modeling (RSEM) capabilities have been expanded (Asparouhov and Muthén 2021). This allows for considerably simpler model syntax for the RI-CLPM using the ^ command. You can find Mplus syntax using this alternative hats-notation for the basic RI-CLPM (both with and without constraints over time) in the Residual syntax section.\n\n\n\nThe RI-CLPM\nTo specify the RI-CLPM we need four parts.\n\nA between part, consisting of the random intercepts. It is specified using the BY command, RIx BY x1@1 x2@1 ...;, where @1 fixes the factor loading to one.\nA within part, consisting of within-unit fluctuations. It is also specified using the BY command, wx1 BY x1; wx2 BY x2; .... We do not have to constrain the factor loading to 1, as this is already the default in Mplus for the factor loading of the first indicator of a latent variable. However, we do need to constrain the measurement error variances to zero, as Mplus will include them by default when we use the BY statement. We do this by including x1@0 x2@0 x3@0 x4@0 x5@0; where @0 fixes the measurement error variances to zero, which is the same as saying there is no measurement error.\nThe lagged regressions between the within-unit components, using wx2 ON wx1 wy1; wx3 ON wx2 wy2; ....\nRelevant covariances in both the between and within part. In the within part the components at wave 1, and their residuals at waves 2 and further are correlated within each wave, using wx1 WITH wy1; wx2 WITH wy2;.... For the between part we have to specify that the random intercepts are correlated using RIx WITH RIy;.\n\n\nBasic modelConstraints over timeConstrain standardized lagged effects\n\n\nThe syntax for specifying the basic RI-CLPM is given below.\nTITLE:      The basic RI-CLPM, 5 waves. \n       \nDATA:       FILE = RICLPM.dat;\n                    \nVARIABLE:   NAMES = x1-x5 y1-y5;\n    \nANALYSIS:   MODEL = NOCOV; !

A label is specified by adding (label) after a parameter. Below we specify a RI-CLPM with the following constraints:\n\nfixed auto-regressive and cross-lagged relations over time, (a b c d),\ntime-invariant (residual) (co-)variances in the within-person part (cov), (vx), and (vy), and\nconstrained grand means over time, (mx) and (my).\n\nTITLE:      The basic RI-CLPM, 5 waves. \n            Constrain the grand means, (residual) variances, and \n            lagged effects over time.   \n    \nDATA:       FILE = RICLPM.dat;  \n                \nVARIABLE:   NAMES = x1-x5 y1-y5;\n    \nANALYSIS:   MODEL = NOCOV; !

Compared to the basic model, there are multiple changes to the syntax. First, we freely estimate the factor loadings that link the observed variables to the within-components, rather than fixing them to 1:\n! Create within-components with freely estimated factor loadings\nwx1 BY x1*; \nwx2 BY x2*;\nwx3 BY x3*; \nwx4 BY x4*; \nwx5 BY x5*;\n                \nwy1 BY y1*; \nwy2 BY y2*;\nwy3 BY y3*; \nwy4 BY y4*; \nwy5 BY y5*;\nSecond, we set the variances of within-components at first wave to 1, and label the covariance (now also the correlation) between them:\n! Set variances of within-components at first wave to 1\nwx1@1 wy1@1;\n\n! Estimate correlation between within-components at first wave\nwx1 WITH wy1 (cor1);\nThird, we give the residual variance and covariances between the within-component each a unique label:\nwx2 WITH wy2 (rcov2); wx2 (rvx2); wy2 (rvy2);\nwx3 WITH wy3 (rcov3); wx3 (rvx3); wy3 (rvy3);\nwx4 WITH wy4 (rcov4); wx4 (rvx4); wy4 (rvy4); \nwx5 WITH wy5 (rcov5); wx5 (rvx5); wy5 (rvy5);\nFinally, we compute the correlations between the within-components themselves at each wave, and then constrain the residual variances to ensure that the total variance of each within-component equals 1. This is done in the MODEL CONSTRAINT command:\nMODEL CONSTRAINT:\n  ! Compute correlations of within-components at each wave\n  NEW(cor2);\n  NEW(cor3);\n  NEW(cor4);\n  \n  cor2 = a*c + b*d + a*d*cor1 + b*c*cor1 + rcov2;\n  cor3 = a*c + b*d + a*d*cor2 + b*c*cor2 + rcov3;\n  cor4 = a*c + b*d + a*d*cor3 + b*c*cor3 + rcov4;\n \n  ! Contrain residual variances of within-components such that variance of each \n  ! within-component equals 1\n  rvx2 = 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor1);\n  rvy2 = 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor1);\n  rvx3 = 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor2);\n  rvy3 = 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor2);\n  rvx4 = 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor3);\n  rvy4 = 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor3);\n  rvx5 = 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor4);\n  rvy5 = 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor4);\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension 1: Including time-invariant predictors and outcomes\nUse the tabs below to navigate to the model specification of the RI-CLPM with\n\na time-invariant predictor \\(z_{1}\\) of the observed variables (\\(z_{1}\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) observed),\na time-invariant predictor \\(z_{1}\\) of the random intercepts (\\(z_{1}\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) RIs),\nrandom intercepts predicting a time-invariant outcome \\(z_{2}\\) (RIs \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(z_{2}\\)), or\nwithin components predicting a time-invariant outcome \\(z_{2}\\) (within \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(z_{2}\\)).\n\n\n\\(z_{1}\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) observed\\(z_{1}\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) RIsRIs \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(z_{2}\\)within \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(z_{2}\\)\n\n\nBelow you can find the syntax for a RI-CLPM with 5 waves and a time-invariant predictor \\(z_{1}\\) for the observed variables.

The reason for this is that when we use the BY statement in combination with multiple groups, Mplus will automatically impose the defaults that are associated with strong factorial invariance (Meredith 1993). These defaults are:\n\nequal factor loadings across the groups,\nequal intercepts for the observed variables across the groups, and\nfree latent means in the second (and subsequent) group(s).\n\nIn the context of a multiple-group RI-CLPM, the first constraint is not an issue as all the factor loadings are supposed to be constrained to one in both groups. However, the second constraint on the intercepts and the freeing of the latent means in the second group are not sensible here. There will be fewer observed variables than latent variables defined with a BY statement (i.e., a within-unit part for each observed variable, plus a random intercept for each variable); as a result, we would try to estimate more means than that there were observed. Such a model is unidentified. We should therefore overrule the defaults associated with the mean structure. We do this by adding for the second group [x1 x2 ...]; which frees the intercepts for the observed variables in the second group. Additionally, we include [wx1@0 wx2@0 ... ]; [RIx@0]; for the second group, which ensures all latent means are fixed to zero.\n\nThe basic modelConstrained lagged-parameters\n\n\nBelow you can find the code for a multiple group RI-CLPM with 5 waves.\nTITLE:      Multiple group RI-CLPM, 5 waves. \n            Overruling the Mplus multiple group factor analysis defaults.\n                \nDATA:       FILE = RICLPM-MG.dat;\n                  \nVARIABLE:   NAMES = x1-x5 y1-y5 GROUP;\n            GROUPING = GROUP (1=G1 2=G2);\n        \nANALYSIS:   MODEL = NOCOV; !

Moreover, this notation fixes the measurement error variance of the observed variable to 0, such that, in an RI-CLPM context, x1^ and y3^ can be interpreted as deviations from a person-specific mean. This notation is available from Mplus version 8.7 onward.\nPON and PWITH: These statements define pairwise regression and correlational relationships, respectively. For example, the x1^-x5^ PWITH y1^-y5^; statement in the RI-CLPM model syntax below, defines a covariance between the within-components at the first wave, a residual covariance between the within-components at the second wave, a residual covariance between the within-components at the third wave, etc.\n\n\nThe basic modelConstraints over time\n\n\nTITLE:      The basic RI-CLPM (5 waves), using residual-language of Mplus.\n     \nDATA:       FILE = RICLPM.dat;\n                \nVARIABLE:   NAMES = x1-x5 y1-y5;\n            \nANALYSIS:   MODEL = NOCOV; !

    "text": "This page documents important updates and additions to the Mplus syntax, lavaan code, or the FAQ.\n\n\n\nApril 14, 2024\nThe FAQ has been updated with a question about causal interpretation of estimates from the RI-CLPM.\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2024\nThe FAQ about inclusion of covariates in the RI-CLPM has been updated. The lavaan tab now contains additional explanation about informative hypothesis testing using the GORICA.\n\n\nJuly 6, 2023\nThe FAQ has been updated with information on investgating moderation with the RI-CLPM.\n\n\nJuly 21, 2022\nThe FAQ has been updated with information on how to impose constraints such that the standardized lagged effects can be made time-invariant. Mplus and lavaan model syntax for specifying such a model have been added as well.\n\n\nJune 28, 2022\nThe answer to the FAQ regarding an RI-CLPM for three or more outcomes has been updated with new examples of researchers applying a trivariate RI-CLPM.\n\n\nMay 17, 2022\nThe FAQ has been updated with a link to the powRICLPM R-package. This package is currently developed to allow for user-friendly power analysis for the RI-CLPM.\n\n\nNovember 23, 2021\nResidual model syntax specifications for Mplus have been added, in which the new “hat-notation” of Mplus version 8.7 is used, as well as PON and PWITH statements to allow for simpler input files. Furthermore, the FAQ was updated with the latest information on the RI-CLPM for categorical variables, and a new question and answer concerning development over time in the RI-CLPM was added.\n\n\nJuly 7, 2021\nThe FAQ has been updated with an informal response to some of the conclusions drawn by Orth et al. (2021) regarding the use and appropriateness of the CLPM and RI-CLPM."
