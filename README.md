# RI-CLPM & Extensions

Here we provide Lavaan-code and Mplus syntax for the increasingly popular Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model, as well as some popular extensions.

### Prerequisites

If you want to run the model in Lavaan, you need to install and load the Lavaan-package in R. 

```
install.packages('lavaan', dependencies = T)
require(lavaan)
```
If you want to run the model using Mplus, you can purchase the software package at http://statmodel.com/.
